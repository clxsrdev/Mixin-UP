## About Mixin'UP‚ùî

Hello to all future scientists and explorers! Today I present to you an incredible educational game that will take you on an exciting cosmic journey. Meet Mixin'UP, the gaming app that will challenge your creativity and problem-solving skills.

In this game, you will have to mix different elements to create new materials and advance through each level. The higher you go, the harder it will get, which means you'll have to think outside the box and be cunning to find the right combination of elements.

But that's not all, Mixin'UP has been created with SwiftUI for a fluid and stunning design and functionality! What does that mean? The user experience will be completely intuitive, easy to use, and allow you to fully enjoy the game.

It's worth noting that I developed the application for dynamic, interactive, and fun learning purposes. The icons used were designed by Flaticon and Canva, two platforms that allow us to use copyright-free material.

Are you ready to accept the challenge and explore the Earth, the sky, and space?
